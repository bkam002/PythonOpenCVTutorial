README for Python OpenCV Tutorial

	•	Before starting this tutorial, I recommend watching this presentation:”https://www.team254.com/documents/vision-control/“, which teaches the conceptual side on how vision tracking works

	•	These vision tracking apps will be made in Python (easiest to learn and adapt for vision). Quick run-down of Python: http://python4java.necaiseweb.org/

	•	Installation process:
			⁃	Download Anaconda from this website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos
			⁃	Follow this short tutorial on installing OpenCV on Anaconda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ16qg9DoiQ

	•	Instructional lectures on the youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHa1s-EL3vjr0Z02ihr6Lcu4Q0rnRvjm

	•	Supplementary text to go along with the youtube tutorials: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html

	•	OpenCVDatasets folder contains sample images and videos(SOON TM) to test out code when learning OpenCV

	•	OpenCVInteractiveTutorialPrograms folder contains programs made in conjunction with the Youtube tutorial. Note that the file paths are from macOS, so you may need to change them to fit your operating system and your own file path. Please make an honest attempt to make the programs shown in the video on your own before looking at these files. 

	•	Look at this tutorial once you get comfortable with OpenCV in general: https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vision/introduction.html
